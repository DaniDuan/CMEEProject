    "### Microbes is the most diverse group of organisms known on Earth and plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycling fundamental for a wide range of ecosystem functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence and maintenance of microbial communitiesâ€™ structures under natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions remain central topics in the field of microbial ecology. Current research in dissecting the mechanisms of community assembly generally accept the simultaneous operation of deterministic and stochastic processes ([Chase et al. 2011](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2011.0063), [Posfai et al. 2017](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.028103#fulltext), [Goyal et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-018-0222-x), [Tilman 2004](https://www.pnas.org/content/101/30/10854)), that the emergence of community structures is governed by fitness selection (survival and growth), drift, speciation and spatial dispersal ([Vellend (2010)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44689600_Conceptual_Synthesis_in_Community_Ecology)). And these ecological processes are influenced by nutrient availability, environmental filtering (e.g. temperature, pH, moisture) and interspecies interactions (e.g. cross-feeding, competition)([Chesson 2000](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.343)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature is one of the fundamental factors for microbial metabolism, regulating the reaction rates of enzyme activities which controls growth rate and species interactions. In response to the rapid development of sequencing technologies ([Kirk et al. 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701204000983), [Theron et al. 2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408410091154174), [Tiedje et al. 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139399000268)), rising number of empirical field studies were conducted interpreting the diversity patterns of microbial communities, however have reported different results regarding the tendency of microbial diversity across temperatures ([Thompson et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24621), [Zhou et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12083?origin=ppub#Abs1), [Kolton et al. 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00870/full)). The hardship in deriving a universal temperature response pattern for diversity is generally caused by the difficulty in disentangling multiple biotic and abiotic impacting factors in determining community structure ([Zhou et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16881-7), [Hendershot et al. 2017](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1829)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) reflects the ability of organics decomposition in relation to the ecosystem function of carbon cycling. CUE describes the ratio of carbon assimilation and carbon intake, which considers organic matter decomposition, biomass production and carbon loss through respiration and extracellular secretion of organic carbon ([Bardgett et al. 2008](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej200858)). The general effect of temperature on CUE is difficult to predict since all processes mentioned above are related to microbial metabolism and enzyme reactions, which would all be impacted by temperature factor ([Davidson & Janssens 2006](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04514), [Gang et al. 2019](https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-resources-and-ecology/volume-10/issue-1/j.issn.1674-764x.2019.01.009/A-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Effects-of-Warming-and-Elevated/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2019.01.009.full), [Smith et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13109-1)) but at different degrees depending on their temperature sensitivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "While [Domeignoz-Horta et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17502-z) reported the positive correlation between soil microbial diversity and CUE through an empirical study on global warming, the selection of CUE during the stabilizing process of the community can also be a driver for regulating community diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims at understanding the role environmental temperature plays on microbial diversity and CUE. In this study, I disentangle the natural abiotic deterministic factors impacting community assembly, focus on the emergence of heterotrophic mesophilic bacterial community diversity patterns under operational temperatures, the CUE patterns of the resultant communities, and the relationship between microbial diversity and CUE. \n",
    "\n",
    "I start with randomly generated microbial communities to circumvent the issue of the complication of numerous hard-to-measure parameters in ecosystems, with the idea that the general resource-consumer model with random parameters can reproduce empirical observations of microbial community assembly ([Goldford et al. 2018](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6401/469)). Then impose selective pressure of resources and interspecies interactions under thermodynamic constraints, using temperature responses of species traits derived from empirical data. "
